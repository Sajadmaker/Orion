## üìñ Usage

Orion is packed with a comprehensive set of tools, organized into three main categories:

### Network & Infrastructure Tools

These tools are designed to help you uncover critical details about networks, servers, IP addresses, DNS records, and more:

1. **Associated Hosts**: Identify domains linked to the target.
2. **DNS Over HTTPS**: Securely resolve DNS queries using encrypted channels.
3. **DNS Records**: Retrieve DNS records, including A, AAAA, MX, and more.
4. **DNSSEC Check**: Verify the proper configuration of DNSSEC.
5. **Domain Info**: Gather domain details such as registrar information and expiration dates.
6. **Domain Reputation Check**: Assess the trustworthiness of a domain using multiple reputation sources.
7. **IP Info**: Obtain geographic and ownership details for a given IP address.
8. **Open Ports Scan**: Scan the target for open ports and running services.
9. **Server Info**: Extract key server details using advanced techniques.
10. **Server Location**: Determine the physical location of the server.
11. **SSL Chain Analysis**: Analyze the SSL certificate chain for trust and validity.
12. **SSL Expiry Alert**: Monitor SSL certificates for upcoming expirations.
13. **TLS Cipher Suites**: List the TLS cipher suites supported by the server.
14. **TLS Handshake Simulation**: Simulate a TLS handshake to identify potential security issues.
15. **Traceroute**: Trace the network path to the target.
16. **TXT Records**: Fetch TXT records, often used for verification and configuration.
17. **WHOIS Lookup**: Perform WHOIS queries to retrieve domain ownership details.
18. **Zone Transfer**: Attempt DNS zone transfers to gather additional information.
19. **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support Checker**: Verify if the server supports HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 protocols.

### Web Application Analysis Tools

These modules focus on understanding the structure, performance, and security of web applications:

20. **Archive History**: Explore the target's historical data using internet archives.
21. **Broken Links Detection**: Identify broken links that may impact user experience or security.
22. **Carbon Footprint**: Evaluate the environmental impact of a website.
23. **CMS Detection**: Detect the content management system (CMS) in use, such as WordPress or Joomla.
24. **Cookies Analyzer**: Analyze cookies for secure attributes and potential privacy concerns.
25. **Content Discovery**: Uncover hidden directories, files, and endpoints.
26. **Crawler**: Crawl the site to map its structure and gather data.
27. **Robots.txt Analyzer**: Analyze the `robots.txt` file for hidden or restricted resources.
28. **Directory Finder**: Search for directories that may not be publicly indexed.
29. **Email Harvesting**: Extract email addresses associated with the target domain.
30. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor the website's response time and load performance.
31. **Quality Metrics**: Assess the quality of the site's content and user experience.
32. **Redirect Chain**: Analyze redirect chains for potential security risks.
33. **Sitemap Parsing**: Extract URLs from the site's sitemap.
34. **Social Media Presence Scan**: Identify and analyze social media profiles linked to the target.
35. **Technology Stack Detection**: Detect the technologies and frameworks powering the site.
36. **Third-Party Integrations**: Identify third-party services integrated into the site.

### Security & Threat Intelligence Tools

These modules are designed to assess the target's security posture and gather threat intelligence:

37. **Censys Reconnaissance**: Leverage Censys for detailed insights into the target's assets.
38. **Certificate Authority Recon**: Examine the certificate authority details.
39. **Data Leak Detection**: Check for potential data leaks and sensitive information exposure.
40. **Exposed Environment Files Checker**: Identify publicly accessible `.env` files.
41. **Firewall Detection**: Detect the presence of firewalls or web application firewalls (WAFs).
42. **Global Ranking**: Check the site's global ranking to gauge its popularity.
43. **HTTP Headers**: Analyze HTTP response headers for security configurations.
44. **HTTP Security Features**: Verify the presence of secure HTTP headers like HSTS and CSP.
45. **Malware & Phishing Check**: Scan the site for signs of malware or phishing activity.
46. **Pastebin Monitoring**: Search paste sites for leaks related to the target.
47. **Privacy & GDPR Compliance**: Assess the site's compliance with GDPR and other privacy regulations.
48. **Security.txt Check**: Locate and analyze the `security.txt` file for vulnerability disclosure policies.
49. **Shodan Reconnaissance**: Use Shodan to discover open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
50. **SSL Labs Report**: Generate a detailed SSL/TLS assessment via SSL Labs.
51. **SSL Pinning Check**: Verify if SSL pinning is implemented on the site.
52. **Subdomain Enumeration**: Discover subdomains associated with the target domain.
53. **Subdomain Takeover**: Test for subdomain takeover vulnerabilities.
54. **VirusTotal Scan**: Check the target's reputation using VirusTotal.
